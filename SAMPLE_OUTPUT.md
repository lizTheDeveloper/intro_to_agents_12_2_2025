[Meeting Start]

Alice: Good morning everyone! Thanks for joining today's product planning meeting.
Let's go over our Q1 roadmap.

Bob: Hi Alice, hi everyone. I think we should prioritize the mobile app redesign.
Our user feedback has been pretty clear on that.

Alice: Good point. Charlie, can you take the lead on gathering all the user 
feedback and creating a summary document by end of this week?

Charlie: Sure, I can do that. I'll have it ready by Friday.

Bob: I'll also need someone to review the current design mockups. Alice, could 
you handle that?

Alice: Yes, I'll review them by next Tuesday and provide feedback.

Charlie: One more thing - we need to schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss 
the technical implementation. Bob, can you send out a calendar invite for 
next week?

Bob: Will do. I'll send that out today.

Alice: Great! Let's also make sure we update the project timeline in Notion.
Charlie, can you handle that as well?

Charlie: Yep, I'll update it along with the feedback summary.

Alice: Perfect. Anything else before we wrap up?

Bob: I think that covers it. Thanks everyone!

Alice: Thanks all! Have a great day.
