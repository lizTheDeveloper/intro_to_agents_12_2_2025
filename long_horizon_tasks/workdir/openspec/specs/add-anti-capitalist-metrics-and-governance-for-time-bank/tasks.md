## 1. Specification
- [ ] 1.1 Identify all existing `time-bank` requirements that touch governance, balances, moderation, and transactions.
- [ ] 1.2 Draft `time-bank` spec deltas to add:
- [ ] 1.2.1 Governance and community rules for the community bank (eligibility, rule changes, collective decision-making).
- [ ] 1.2.2 Equity and accessibility policies (membership for people who cannot always reciprocate, anti-hoarding measures, safeguards against reproducing class/race hierarchies).
- [ ] 1.2.3 Community health and safety requirements (restorative dispute handling, non-punitive feedback mechanisms, safety safeguards).
- [ ] 1.2.4 Data, privacy, and community control over metrics (what is measured, how it is aggregated, how the community can review or veto metrics).
- [ ] 1.3 Define an initial set of anti-capitalist success metrics and capture them as requirements and scenarios (e.g., redistribution/equity, participation/resilience, safety/care/governance).
- [ ] 1.4 Decide whether a separate `community-bank-governance` capability spec is needed or whether all governance requirements remain within `time-bank`.

## 2. Spec Deltas
- [ ] 2.1 Create `openspec/changes/add-anti-capitalist-metrics-and-governance-for-time-bank/specs/time-bank/spec.md` with `## ADDED` and/or `## MODIFIED` Requirements covering:
- [ ] 2.1.1 Community-bank governance rules.
- [ ] 2.1.2 Equity and accessibility behavior.
- [ ] 2.1.3 Community health and safety mechanisms.
- [ ] 2.1.4 Metrics and reporting that are non-extractive and community-controlled.
- [ ] 2.2 If needed, add `specs/community-bank-governance/spec.md` in this change with governance-specific requirements.

## 3. Review and Iteration
- [ ] 3.1 Review proposed requirements and metrics with project stakeholders and (where possible) community representatives.
- [ ] 3.2 Refine requirements and scenarios based on feedback to better align with anti-capitalist and mutual-aid goals.
- [ ] 3.3 Ensure all new requirements include at least one `#### Scenario:` and conform to OpenSpec validation rules.
