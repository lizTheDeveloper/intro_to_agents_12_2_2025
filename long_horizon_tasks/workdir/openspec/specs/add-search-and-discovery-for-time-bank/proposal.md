# Change: Add Search and Discovery for Time Bank

## Why
Members currently can create offers and requests, but the spec does not describe how they efficiently find relevant help opportunities. Without search and discovery, members may struggle to match needs with offers, reducing the effectiveness and engagement of the time bank.

## What Changes
- Introduce search and filtering for offers and requests by skill/category, location/area, and availability.
- Add support for sorting results (e.g., by recency or relevance).
- Add basic discovery surfaces such as "featured" or "nearby" offers and requests.

## Impact
- Affected specs: `time-bank`.
- Affected code: listing/browse APIs or pages for offers and requests, any data indexing or query layer used for searching and filtering.
