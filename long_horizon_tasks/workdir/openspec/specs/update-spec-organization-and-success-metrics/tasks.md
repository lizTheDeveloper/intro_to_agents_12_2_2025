## 1. Spec organization and deduplication
- [ ] 1.1 Identify and document overlapping requirements between `add-notifications-for-time-bank` and `add-notifications-spec` and decide canonical wording.
- [ ] 1.2 Add a `notifications` delta in this change that reconciles triggers, preferences, and delivery semantics.

## 2. Time-bank missing definitions + lifecycle
- [ ] 2.1 Add requirements defining the help session lifecycle (states, acceptance, cancellation/no-show, completion confirmation, dispute window).
- [ ] 2.2 Add requirements defining community roles (member, moderator/steward/governor) and permission boundaries.

## 3. Anti-capitalist success metrics embedded in specs
- [ ] 3.1 Add requirements for community-controlled, aggregate-only metrics (no per-member rankings).
- [ ] 3.2 Define a minimal set of success metrics (redistribution, inclusion, participation, safety/restorative outcomes, governance legitimacy).
- [ ] 3.3 Add requirements that metric changes require governance approval and are transparent to members.

## 4. Consistency cleanup
- [ ] 4.1 Normalize `openspec/specs/time-bank/spec.md` heading to `## Requirements` (and any other truth specs that use delta headings).
- [ ] 4.2 Validate this change proposal format and scenarios for OpenSpec compliance.
